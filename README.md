ECS 160 Project Android Version

Welcome! 
This is "dev" branch where we push the most recent, stable working version of Android Team's work.


11/05/2018
  < What you can do in this version ? >
  - move map(using two finger drag)
  - select unit and move the selected unit(no awesome animation yet) (just tap the unit and tap location to move)
  - live minimap with assets on it (depicted as a dot)
  
IF you want to test the android version for fun, try install the "app-debug" apk file.


tbh, currently units are so small that it is hard to select unit, but bear with it xD
Also, buttons are for display only now, don't be fooled or don't throw any question like why it doesn't work. (It looks nice at least.)


Thank you all.
